## Process
This repo contains references to the subrepos for the frontend and backend, you can access them by clicking on the files above.
The frontend is built with next.js and react, and uses next-ws to build the realtime multiplayer functionality.
The backend uses go and pgx to store data in a postgresql database.

## Background
I made this to play with friends during christmas. This is the common [White Elephant](https://www.whiteelephantrules.com/) game, but instead of physical gifts players 'bring' video games from the popular game store [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). The app doesn't handle any money or assets itself, it's just a game to see where the gifts end up, and the players would then gift the games themselves through Steam.
